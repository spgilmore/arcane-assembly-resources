# Arcane Assembly Walkthrough

## Prologue / Green Area

Start the game, do the instructional walkthrough with your father.  This begins your journey through the green area of the map.

At the end of the walkthrough, import these spells and bind them however you like:
- Early Stream

Continue traversing the landscape until you acquire the _Repeat_ scroll.

Import these spells:
- Stream
- Pry
- Scissor
- Wide Cannon

Delete these spells:
- Early Stream

### Boss: Apocrita the Immense, Torturer of 1000 Men
You will come to a screen where you must fight the giant bee.  Conquer him with the _Stream_ spell and proceed to the town of Lushleaf Village.  

### Lushleaf Village
There are houses here without doors.  Only one door exists for now.  It is the potion shop.  If you have enough gold, updgrade your health or Mana by buying a potion.  The potions are not really potions - they are one-time permanent and immediate upgrades to your character.  Buy them any chance you get.  

Sit on the bench to recover your flasks and health if you need to.

Head right and down.  You'll encounter a bench.  Sit on it and head right.  Traverse the spikes, swinging vines etc. and acquire the _Magnify Speed_ scroll.

Import these spells:
- Orb Shield
- Orb Decoy

Continue left and you can drop down to where you started.  Got left one screen and save at the bench.

### Boss: Arach the Black
Proceed left and traverse the map to find and battle the giant spider, Arach.  There is only one path to take.  When you defeat the spider, you will obtain the Sharp aspect scroll.  

Update these spells by adding it to the aspectList.

- Stream
- Pry
- Scissor
- Wide Cannon
- Orb Shield
- Orb Decoy

To continue left, you must destroy a web wall using Sharp orbs.  Proceed left and again use Sharp orbs to free Flynn the Alchemist.  He will help you on your way.

Proceed back whence you started by climbing up, then right.  Activate the first portal as you pass it.  Continue right, destroying a web wall as you go and save at the bench.  Continue right until you get a chance to go down.  You can obtain a blue gem (Eth Crystal).  Go back up and left to the portal and return to Lushleaf Village.  You'll find a new door has appeared on one of the houses, allowing you to do business with the alchemist.  You will also notice a second and third "notch" in this screen on the map.  That means this many doors have been "unlocked" in the village.

Visit the alchemist and he will gift you 2 red gems (Vis Shards).  You still don't have enough crystals to get any upgrades from him yet. 

If you have enough gold, buy more mana potions from the witch at the potion shop.

## Teal Area (Whispering Peaks)
Save at the bench when you're ready to depart.  Head right and then up to the web wall and destroy it to enter Whispering Peaks.  It is the teal area of the map in the upper-right corner.

This area is easier when using the Orb Shield or Orb Decoy spells to dodge the flying monsters and take them out as you go.

Battle your way all the way to the right and get the blue gem.  Then move up a few screens to get the red gem.  Then move left a few screens to complete the lower loop of this area on the map.  On the screen where the loop meets on the left, drop down to collect another red gem and pull the lever to open the gate, making this an upward shortcut in this area from now on.  

Head left one more screen and activate the portal.  Return to Lushleaf village and spend your new shards to upgrade your flask.  You should have 2 blue and 4 red shards, allowing you one upgrade only the Flask Number.  The shards cannot be spent elsewhere, so buy it now.  Sit on the bench to recover, then hit the portal to return to Whispering Peaks.  


### Boss: Nyxius, the Winged Terror
We now go left just one screen and it's another boss fight.  Before going, make sure you sat on a bench in Lushleaf Village first.  Go left to confront the giant bat, Nyxius.  Conquer the bat and the _Ignite_ aspect scroll will be your reward.

Modify these spells and add the _Ignite_ aspect to them:

- Stream
- Pry
- Scissor
- Wide Cannon
- Orb Shield
- Orb Decoy

Head left and recover on the bench.  Proceed upward a couple of screens to get to the upper loop of the teal area.  You'll know you're there when you see 3 unexplored adjacent areas on the map.  From here, go to the left of the three screens and collect the Major Artifact.  Return to the loop and head up 4 screens.  Along the way, sit on the bench and activate the portal.  At the very top, you will find the _Ward_ scroll.

The Ward scroll is not very useful yet except in one specific form.  And it just so happens that there is a built-in spell for it.  Upon acquiring the _Ward_ scroll, open your spell book and create a new spell.  In the Choose Template screen, choose "Throw_Ward".  Edit the name and set it to "Throw Ward" and leave the rest the same.  Bind it to a convenient key.  Practice with it.  You'll need to be comfortable throwing it up several times in front of you at about 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock and 3 o'clock to block things that are coming at you later on.  Get a feel for how far away the ward will appear.  Then hed left and use it to create a passage under the fiery waterfall that guard the Minor Artifact on the other side.  Go back the way you came and sit on the bench below the portal.  At that point, continue counter-clockwise around the loop.  You will go around the bottom, to the right, back up and then to the left.  

The reason you can't do much with it is because it is beause anything other than a specific / targeted spell requires a lot of wards to protect you.  It is very expensive to cast spells with a lot of wards.  They involve a lot of steps to maneuver the wards into the places where they might be useful in defending you. Nevertheless, there are some warding spells included for you to play with.  You can import them now:

- Ward Halo
- Semi Halo
- Ward Burst
- Semi Burst

### Boss: Wraith King
As you round the top-left corner of the upper loop of the teal area, you will encounter the Wraith King.  He's a total dick, so be sure to mess him as fast as you can.  You will need a mastery of your _Throw Ward_ spell to defeat him.  You can try to create more interesting spells using Ward to make this fight easier, but in my experience, you never have enough magic points to use the ward as much as you want.  The _Throw Ward_ spell lets you put it exactly where you want it as few times as is necessary to presever magic points for offenseive spells.  If you have take the time to farm gold and upgrade your magic capacity **substantially**, this may not apply.  

Upon defeating the Wraith King, you obtain the Wraith Cloak.  With it, you can pass through light walls and streams of fireballs.  There will be a lot of that in the remainder of the game.  It can help you travel faster too.   Doing a quick hop in the air and dash with the cloak reapeatedly will skip you across a screen in no time.  Like a double-jump, you can only dash once in the air.  You have to return to the ground to reset it and do another dash.  If you are stuck in an area after defeating the Wraith King, you are probably not using the dash where you should be.

Head right and down to to the right edge of the upper loop to get the blue gem behind the light wall.  Return to the Wraith King's arena and head left until you get to another light wall, dash through it and sit on the bench to recover.  Use the portal to return to Lushleaf Village.  You should have 3 blue gems now, so you can upgrade your Flask Value.

Sell any major or minor artifacts you may have by visiting the two chests in town.  Buy potion upgrades if you can afford them.

## Yellow Area (Scorched Wasteland)
From Lushleaf Village, head right and up toward the teal area.  Still in the green area, you can now dash through the light wall on the left to enter the yellow area of the map.  This area of the map has several tendrils and two loops, one on the left and one on the right.  

On the third yellow screen, you'll encounter a cliff.  Notice the floating magic dot in the air.  When you touch it, it resets your double-jump and dash so you can jump and dash one more time in the air.  Use it to jump onto the cliff to the left.

When you come to the bench, you cannot proceed left and most move upward into the bottom of the right loop on the map.  Traverse the loop counter-clockwise. When you get to the bench (at the right edge of the loop), keep going all the way to the last screen before continuing the right loop.  You'll find a red gem there.

### Boss: Aridrax the Desert Devourer
Continue counter-clockwise around the loop and you will battle the giant caterpillar.  His demise yields the _Connect_ scroll.  This is the first magic update in a while, so we have some new spells to import.

Import these spells:
- Death Wave
- Turbine

The Turbine spell is sometimes a good substitute for the Orb Shield spell.

Continue navigating the right loop.  When you get to the gate near the bottom, flip the switch to open it and then go back and head left out of the loop.  You now begin traversing the top half of the left loop.  When you get to the bench at the left of the loop, you can deviate up or to the left.  Go up first and collect the red gem and major artifact.  Return to the intersection with the bench and head left.  When you obtain the Spawn With Offset scroll, import these spells:

- Grinder
- Ward Wall
- Booby Trap

When you reach the intersection with the bench again, head down to complete the left loop.  On this loop you will pass another portal for you to activate.  Continue until you encounter a gate.  Use the latch to open it.  Continue to the bench on the next screen if you want, then change direction again and go down and left.  This will lead you to the battle with Ignus.

### Boss: Ignus the Tortured
Ignus is a floating pimple whose head has been lit on fire.  He's strong and uses a ton of fireballs.  Take your time and use your ward spells.  Put him in his place and get his key.  Head left to liberate Emerick the Enchanter.  Head to the nearest portal to travel back to Lushleaf Village.

In town, you should have 3 red gems and can buy another Flask Number.  This brings you to 5.

Visit the home of Emerick, who will gift you a single magic shard.  Trade it back to him for an upgrade to any of your three aspects.  

Sell any artifacts you may have and buy any potions you can afford.

Save at the bench when you're ready, then we head for the purple area.  Head right and then down, then left at the bench.  From there, you can see where the green area connects to the purple area.  Head there and use the key to open the gate.  You can now jump into the pit and arrive in the purple area.

## Purple Area (Abyssal Caverns)

These caverns are pretty simple.  On the map, the purple area is shaped like a large X (mostly).  First we'll head to the middle of the X, then down the lower-left leg, upper-right leg and then lower-right leg for the final boss.  Use your Orb Shield and Death Wave constantly and I hope you're comfortable with your double-jump and your dash.  Off we go!

Head to the center of the X, then down the lower-left leg.  Gather the major artifact on your way, then fight Jerich the Swordsman.  He has a mouth on him.  Put some holes in him and obtain the Explode scroll.  You need this to destroy bomb walls, but it can also make a decent booby trap!  Import these spells:

- Minefield
- ClusterBomb

Using the ClusterBomb spell, destroy the bomb wall on the left.  Collect the red gem and the magic shard, then return to the center of the X.  Heading right, activate the portal, then veer upward to the upper-right leg of the X.

At the fork with the bench, keep right.  We want to collect the Enemy Angle scroll as soon as we can.  Once you acquire it, you can finally import:

- HomingMissiles

The Homing Missiles spell will find the nearest enemy and hurtle toward it.  Periodically throughout its flight, it will re-adjust its trajectory.  In this way it will chase moving targets.

If there are no enemies on the screen, it just shoots straight to the right.  This isn't pretty, but it does no hard and has the added benefit of telling you that there are no enemies left on the current screen.

Head left and then up to collect the red gem.  Then back to the center of the X.  When you get to the bench near the center of the X, turn down and right.  This is the final trail to the final boss.

There are a couple of puzzle rooms here.  For the first, you will find a room with 3 teleportation bubbles, each on their own "floor".  Enter the top one.  

The second puzzle room is traversed like this:
- Enter the bubble.  You will land on the spike platform on the other end.
- Double-jump, then dash through the fire wall.
- Ignore the refresh dot and fall directly underneath the spike sentry.  You will land on a bounce pad.
- Bounce over the spike sentry on the left and onto the stable platform.
- Dash through the firewall, on the left, catch the refresh dot, then double-jump and dash to the spike platform.
- Enter the bubble and come out on solid ground.  Enter the next bubble on the right and you will travel all the way to the right edge of the screen.  Proceed to the right.  
- On the next screen, enter the last bubble.

Activate the portal.  Travel to Lushleave Village and upgrade one of your aspects with the magic shard you found.  Sell artifacts, buy potions and return through the portal to the "Cavern Bench".  Sit on the bench to save.  The next screen to the right is the final boss battle. Homing missiles will not avail you well here.  Switch to the Cluster Bomb spell.  It eats this boss alive.
